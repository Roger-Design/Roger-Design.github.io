First things first a big thank you to the project [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on Github as the first blog was heavily inspired by it, currently I am using [this theme](https://tianqi.name/jekyll-TeXt-theme/), do check either of these two out if you are looking for a simple to set up and nice looking blog theme!

Now what is this blog about? This blog will go over the different things I am reading/studying and also a handful of individual projects to help keep me honest and focused on producing them within a reasonable amount of time. 

This blog us under the watchful eyes of El Capitan/El Huaso Primero, and will receive (hopefully) regular design and palette updates to keep it looking as nice as it can, to the best of my poor design abilities.
